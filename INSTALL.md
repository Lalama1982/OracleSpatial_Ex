# Installation
Copy the dino-date directory to the machine you will use as your server.  This location will need to meet the requirements for the language you intend to use.

## Database Instructions

**IMPORTANT - Please make sure you're using a database instance in which you can safely create schema named 'DD', 'DD_NON_EBR' AND 'DD_LOGGER'.**

### Prerequisite Technologies
[Logger](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger)

### Installation
1. Download and unzip logger into the coreDatabase directory.
 You will use the new Logger directory name to answer the question in step 5, e.g. logger_3.1.1
2. Check the end of Logger's create_user.sql file, if you see an exit, remove it.
3. Navigate to the coreDatabase directory.
4. Using an application such as SQL*Plus or [SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/overview/index.html), run **dd_master_install.sql** connected as SYSDBA.
5. The first prompt asks for the directory you extracted logger into, e.g. logger_3.1.1
6. The second prompt asks for what you want to name the logger schema, e.g. dd_logger
7. The third and fourth prompts are asking for your Tablespace and Temporary Tablespace
8. The fourth prompt asks for the logger schema password, e.g. dd

## Configure Your Environment

DinoDate uses environment variables for database connection and port settings.

Create the following environment variables using the correct values for your system.
* dd_connectString=localhost:1521/orcl
* dd_user=dd
* dd_password=dd
* dd_port=8888
* dd_python_port=8080
* dd_node_port=3000
* dd_clientAppCodeDir=jet
* dd_python_clientAppCodeDir=jet
* dd_node_clientAppCodeDir=jet

Variables such as dd_port and dd_clientAppCodeDir have language specific variations if you would like to run multiple environments at the same time.

If you only plan to run one at at time you do not need to include the language variations.
